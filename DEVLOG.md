Printed the base frame, damn it's big

Going to first check if the different brand VL53L0X sensors have different addresses... I hope so

Also I'm using a full Raspberry Pi desktop this time so gotta make sure remote SSH works too

First thing I'll do is make sure I have 3 of these sensors and that I can connect all 3 to the RPi without a microcontroller in between eg. arduino/seeduino.

Damn I only have two of them right now ugh... alright I'll order some more now

The other concern/project killer is, is it accurate enough.

I can still work on this without all 3
