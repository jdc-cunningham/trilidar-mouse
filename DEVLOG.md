- [ ] create code that outputs x, y values
- [ ] create basic website that is the visual mouse position
- [ ] bridge the two with a websocket

Later

- [ ] figure out how to make a USB mouse, bluetooth maybe too

Back on

Thinking about how to make it smaller

Also considering adding the two buttons as a 3D printed add on thing but I'll focus on making this thing work

Max distance is 3" per sensor towards middle

3:58 PM

Finally past the dumb sensor mapping stuff with buses/addresses

Engaging the Kornholio

Gonna do something easy real quick (the web interface/socket bridge) then back to the trig summing

6:21 PM

I have to get ready to drive UberEats/DoorDash soon

Gonna call it here for now, I need to think about the math part more

I'll work on the video

Printed the base frame, damn it's big

Going to first check if the different brand VL53L0X sensors have different addresses... I hope so

Also I'm using a full Raspberry Pi desktop this time so gotta make sure remote SSH works too

First thing I'll do is make sure I have 3 of these sensors and that I can connect all 3 to the RPi without a microcontroller in between eg. arduino/seeduino.

Damn I only have two of them right now ugh... alright I'll order some more now

The other concern/project killer is, is it accurate enough.

I can still work on this without all 3
